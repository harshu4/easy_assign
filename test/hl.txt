1(b). a program that solves the following equation and
displays the value x and y:
1) 3.4x+50.2y=44.5
2) 2.1x+.55y=5.9
---!---
(Assume Cramer’s rule to solve equation
ax+by=e 			x=ed-bf/ad-bc
cx+dy=f 			y=af-ec/ad-bc )

1(c). A program that reads a number in meters, converts it to feet,
and displays the result.
---!---
1(d). A program that prompts the
user to enter a weight in pounds and height in inches and displays
the BMI. Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health on weight. It can be
calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing by the
square of your height in meters.
Note:- 1 pound=.45359237 Kg and 1 inch=.0254 meters.

5)Write a program that prompts the user to enter a decimal number
and displays the number in a fraction.
Hint: Read the decimal number as a string, extract the integer part
and fractional part from the string.
